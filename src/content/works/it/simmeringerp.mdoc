### Process

Simmering ERP is designed to simplify the complex daily operations of a restaurant. We collaborated closely with industry experts and restaurant owners to understand the unique challenges faced in managing multiple aspects of restaurant operations, inventory control, employee scheduling, customer service, and accounting.

The goal was to create a unified platform that could handle everything from tracking stock levels, automating order management, and scheduling staff to integrating with POS systems for seamless transactions. By combining all of these functions into one intuitive interface, Simmering ERP helps restaurants reduce administrative workload and optimize workflows.

We implemented a cloud-based infrastructure, ensuring that restaurant managers can access real-time data on inventory levels, sales, and customer preferences from any device. We also integrated data analytics tools to support decision-making, enabling managers to predict demand, control food costs, and minimize waste.
