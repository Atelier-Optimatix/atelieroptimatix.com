### Process

This project focused on enhancing efficiency across a high-throughput manufacturing environment through intelligent automation and system-level optimisation. We began with a thorough assessment of existing operations,identifying inefficiencies in resource allocation, production flow, and maintenance routines.

Working closely with plant engineers and operations teams, we deployed a network of IoT-enabled sensors to collect real-time data from key equipment. This allowed us to map performance trends and identify critical bottlenecks. Building on this foundation, we designed and implemented an AI-powered control system capable of dynamically adjusting to production variability, ensuring stable output and efficient use of energy and materials.

A key part of the solution involved integrating predictive maintenance models that could detect anomalies before they led to costly breakdowns, thereby reducing unexpected downtime.
