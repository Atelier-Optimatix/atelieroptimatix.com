#### 1. Overview and Policy Statement

This Refund Policy outlines the terms and conditions under which Atelier Optimatix (PVT) LTD ("we," "our," "us") processes refund requests for payments made through our platform. We are committed to fair and transparent refund practices while balancing the operational needs of our partner educational institutions.

This policy applies to all payment transactions processed through our Services, including one-time payments and recurring subscriptions. Please read this policy carefully before making any payments, as your use of our payment services constitutes acceptance of these terms.

#### 2. General Refund Principles

##### 2.1 Eligibility Assessment

Refund requests are evaluated based on multiple factors:
- Type of payment (one-time vs. subscription)
- Reason for refund request
- Timing of request relative to payment date
- Service delivery status
- School-specific policies and circumstances
- Previous refund history

##### 2.2 Refund Request Timing

To be eligible for consideration, refund requests must generally be submitted:
- Within 14 calendar days of the original payment date for one-time payments
- Before the start of the billing period for subscription services
- As soon as reasonably possible after discovering an issue

Late requests may still be considered under exceptional circumstances at our sole discretion.

##### 2.3 Required Documentation

Refund requests should include:
- Transaction reference number or payment confirmation
- Date of payment and amount paid
- Detailed explanation of the reason for the refund request
- Supporting documentation where applicable (e.g., proof of duplicate payment)
- Account holder information for verification purposes

#### 3. One-Time Payments

##### 3.1 Eligible Circumstances

Refunds for one-time payments may be granted when:

**Service Not Delivered:**
- The school service or program was not provided as described
- The student did not receive access to paid resources or facilities
- Technical issues prevented service access without resolution

**Duplicate or Erroneous Charges:**
- Multiple charges for the same transaction due to technical error
- Incorrect payment amount charged
- Payment made to wrong school or service

**Unauthorized Transactions:**
- Fraudulent transactions made without account holder authorization
- Payments made due to security breach or compromised account

**Exceptional Circumstances:**
- Student withdrawal before service commencement (subject to school policy)
- Medical emergencies preventing participation
- Other extraordinary situations evaluated case-by-case

##### 3.2 Non-Refundable Situations

Refunds will generally NOT be granted for:
- Change of mind after service has commenced
- Student absence or non-participation without valid reason
- Dissatisfaction with educational services (quality disputes should be addressed with the school)
- Failure to utilize purchased services or access provided resources
- Payments made more than 14 days prior to refund request (except in exceptional cases)

##### 3.3 Partial Refunds

In some circumstances, partial refunds may be appropriate:
- Prorated refunds based on service usage or time elapsed
- Refunds minus non-refundable administrative fees
- Adjusted amounts accounting for services already delivered

#### 4. Subscription Payments

##### 4.1 Subscription Refund Policy

Subscription fees are generally non-refundable due to their advance billing nature. However, we recognize that circumstances may warrant exceptions.

**Current Billing Period:**
- Fees for the current active billing period are typically non-refundable
- Services remain accessible until the end of the paid period
- Cancellation prevents future charges but doesn't refund current period

**Future Billing Periods:**
- Cancellation before renewal date prevents future charges
- No charges or refunds needed for unstarted future periods
- Timely cancellation is the user's responsibility

##### 4.2 Subscription Refund Exceptions

Refunds for subscription payments may be considered when:
- Technical failure prevented service access for significant portion of billing period
- Billing error resulted in incorrect charge amount
- Subscription was not properly canceled despite valid cancellation request
- Fraudulent or unauthorized renewal occurred
- Service was fundamentally unavailable or unusable

##### 4.3 Pro-Rated Refunds

In exceptional cases, we may offer pro-rated refunds calculated as:
- Full subscription fee divided by billing period length
- Multiplied by number of unused days
- Minus any applicable processing fees

Example: For a monthly subscription of LKR 3,000 canceled after 10 days, a pro-rated refund might be calculated as: (LKR 3,000 ÷ 30 days) × 20 unused days = LKR 2,000 (minus processing fees).

#### 5. School-Related Considerations

##### 5.1 School Policy Alignment

Our refund decisions often depend on partner school policies:
- Schools may have specific refund policies for different programs
- Some fees (such as registration or application fees) may be non-refundable per school policy
- Refund eligibility for school-specific services is determined by the relevant institution
- We facilitate refunds in accordance with applicable school policies

##### 5.2 Settlement Complications

Refund processing may be affected by settlement status:

**Before Settlement to School:**
- Refunds are generally processed directly by Atelier Optimatix
- Faster processing time (typically 7-10 business days)
- No school approval required for platform-side issues

**After Settlement to School:**
- Refund approval may require school authorization
- School must agree to return settled funds
- Extended processing time (14-21 business days)
- Limited to circumstances acceptable to the school

##### 5.3 School Communication

For service quality or delivery disputes:
- Contact the school directly first to resolve concerns
- Provide documentation of communication attempts
- Request school support for refund if matter cannot be resolved
- We can facilitate communication but cannot override school decisions on educational matters

These fees are charged by third-party payment processors and banks, not by Atelier Optimatix. We aim to minimize such deductions but cannot always absorb these costs.
