Our team conducted discovery workshops with educators, school administrators, and IT coordinators to understand daily pain points in school operations and student safety workflows.\n\nWe designed and developed EduConnect—a centralised platform combining attendance tracking, digital notices, parent-teacher communication, incident reporting, and real-time alerts. The architecture was built to be modular, secure, and user-friendly, allowing rapid deployment across institutions with varying needs.\n\nThe system integrates seamlessly with existing school databases, supports multi-device access for staff and guardians, and complies with UK safeguarding and data protection standards. We also included an analytics dashboard to help school leaders identify patterns in attendance, engagement, and behaviour.\n\n### Outcome\n\nEduConnect significantly improved operational efficiency and school-wide engagement. With real-time updates and alerts replacing paper-based notices. Most importantly, school leaders now have clearer oversight of safety protocols and attendance patterns.\n\nEduConnect has since been adopted by multiple institutions, proving its adaptability and value across both primary and secondary education settings. The platform continues to evolve with features like multi-language support and smart scheduling under development.\n";
